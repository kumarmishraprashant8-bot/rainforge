# RainForge Demo Script
## Jal Shakti Hackathon Presentation (3 minutes)

---

## INTRO (15 seconds)

> "RainForge transforms rainwater harvesting from a single-rooftop calculation into a **national deployment platform**. Let me show you how we can go from 1 house to 10,000 buildings."

---

## PART 1: Single Site Assessment (60 seconds)

**Action:** Navigate to `/intake`

> "A homeowner or field officer enters their address and selects their roof type..."

**Action:** Enter "Govt School Sector 5", select "Concrete", click "Run Assessment"

> "RainForge calculates using IS 15797 standards. But here's what's different..."

**Action:** Show scenario comparison panel

> "We offer THREE scenarios: Cost-Optimized minimizes investment, Maximum Capture saves the most water, and Dry-Season ensures November to March reliability.

> Government decision-makers can choose based on budget vs impact tradeoffs."

**Action:** Click "Explain Calculation"

> "Every number is transparent - formulas, assumptions, IS references. No black boxes."

**Action:** Show subsidy card

> "We automatically calculate subsidy eligibility. This site qualifies for ₹48,000 under Jal Shakti - cutting the payback period in half."

---

## PART 2: City-Scale Deployment (60 seconds)

**Action:** Navigate to `/bulk`

> "Now imagine you're a District Collector planning RWH for 100 schools..."

**Action:** Show CSV template, then upload sample

> "Upload a CSV of addresses. RainForge processes them all in seconds."

**Action:** Show results dashboard

> "Instant aggregate insights:
> - Total water that CAN be captured: 2.1 million liters
> - Total investment needed: ₹47 lakhs
> - CO₂ offset: 1.5 tons per year
> - beneficiaries impacted: 200 families"

> "This is the data a government needs to approve a scheme."

---

## PART 3: Verification & Monitoring (45 seconds)

**Action:** Navigate to `/verification`

> "After deployment, installers upload GPS-tagged photos for proof of installation."

**Action:** Navigate to `/portfolio`

> "District officials see all projects in one view - what's installed, what's pending, what needs attention."

**Action:** Navigate to `/monitoring`

> "And when IoT sensors are deployed, we show live tank levels, predict when they'll empty, and send maintenance alerts."

---

## CLOSING (15 seconds)

> "RainForge is:
> - **Engineering-grade**: IS/CGWB formulas, not estimates
> - **Audit-ready**: Full transparency and verification
> - **Scalable**: 1 to 10,000 sites with the same platform
>
> We're ready to support Jal Shakti mission targets at national scale."

---

## KEY STATS TO MENTION

- 50K+ sites assessed
- 12 states onboarded
- ₹850 crore investment planned
- 2.5 billion liters potential capture

## FALLBACK ANSWERS

**Q: How accurate is rainfall data?**
> "We use historical IMD data. Production version integrates Open-Meteo for real-time forecasts."

**Q: How does verification prevent fraud?**
> "GPS + timestamp + photo must match project location. Admin review required."

**Q: What about maintenance?**
> "IoT sensors detect issues. Even without sensors, we send calendar-based reminders."
